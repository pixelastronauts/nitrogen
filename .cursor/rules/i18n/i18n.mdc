# i18n Rules

## Configuration Rules

- **NEVER edit the `langDir` configuration in `nuxt.config.ts`** - The langDir is already properly configured and should not be modified
- All locale files are located in `./i18n/locales` directory and should remain there
- Use the existing locale structure: `en.json`, `es.json`, `fr.json`, `nl.json`

## Translation File Management

- Always maintain consistent key structures across all locale files
- When adding new translation keys, add them to ALL locale files (en, es, fr, nl)
- Use nested objects for organized translation keys (e.g., `common.buttons.save`)
- Keep translation keys descriptive and hierarchical

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `$t('key')` for translations in Vue templates
- Use `t('key')` for translations in composition API with `useI18n()`
- Prefer using translation keys over hardcoded strings
- Use interpolation for dynamic content: `$t('message', { name: 'John' })`

## Best Practices

- Always test translations in all supported locales
- Keep translation values concise but descriptive
- Use plural forms when necessary with `$tc()` or the `|` separator
- Maintain consistent tone and style across all languages
- Consider cultural context when translating, not just literal translation
