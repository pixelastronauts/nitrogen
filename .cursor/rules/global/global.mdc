# Global Project Rules

## Development Commands

- Never use 'nvm use 18' - the project should use the Node version specified in package.json or .nvmrc
- Never run `bun run dev` automatically - let the user know when we want to check the development server, but they will run it themselves
- Always use `bun` instead of `npm` for package management and script execution
- Use `bun install` for installing dependencies, `bun add` for adding new packages

## Code Quality

- Follow TypeScript strict mode practices
- Use proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Implement proper type safety throughout the codebase
- Follow ESLint configuration rules (eslint.config.mjs)

## File Organization

- Keep components organized in logical folder structures
- Use composables for reusable logic
- Place types in the `/types` directory
- Organize Shopify-related code in the appropriate modules/shopify structure

## Performance

- Optimize bundle size by avoiding unnecessary imports
- Use lazy loading for components when appropriate
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Minimize client-side JavaScript when possible

## Never Fix These Linter Errors

- Never fix linter errors related to Statamic's Entry and Collection facades - these are faulty and should be ignored
